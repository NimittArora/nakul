Incorporated a user login functionality to allow authorized access to the question database.Ensured that each generated question had corresponding solutions and test cases when necessary.Solution dockerized and deployed currently being used by 3 colleges to generate DSA Questions. 20+ DSA Questions generated and 50+ MCQ Questions generated.",
